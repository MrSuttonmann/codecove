Hi there! I'm **Ted**, a senior software developer living in the *mostly* sunny paradise of [Staffordshire](https://enwp.org/Staffordshire). My coding journey began in 2009 during college, where I fearlessly wielded the mighty [VB.NET](https://enwp.org/Visual_Basic_(.NET)) and [WinForms](https://enwp.org/Windows_Forms) to create small games and simulators. It was cutting-edge stuff... for 2009.

## From Theme Parks to SFTP Adventures :roller_coaster:

In 2011, I took my talents online with my first web app, `RideTrack`, built in the indomitable [PHP](https://enwp.org/PHP). This passion project was born between shifts at a local holiday park and fueled by my yearly pass to [Alton Towers](https://enwp.org/Alton_Towers). Ride stats were serious business—tracking how many times I conquered *Oblivion* or looped on *Nemesis* wasn’t just a hobby; it was a mission.

Back then, my development process was, let’s say, “bold.” Imagine coding over [SFTP](https://enwp.org/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol) using [WinSCP](https://enwp.org/WinSCP). Here’s what I bravely endured:

- No syntax highlighting  
- No IntelliSense  
- No debugging tools  
- No source control  
- **And worst of all... no dark mode**  

Yes, I know—pure chaos. But, hey, it was a personal project with exactly one user: me. It was also an excellent lesson in *how not to develop software*. 

## Desktop Apps and Planes :airplane:

In addition to `RideTrack`, I dabbled in desktop apps. One project—a VB.NET WinForms masterpiece—stemmed from a newfound fascination with [ADS-B](https://enwp.org/ADS-B). Armed with a Raspberry Pi and a USB TV tuner, I started capturing flight data and built a nifty app to display the broadcasts. Nothing screams “fun weekend” like decoding airplane messages!

## Leveling Up: Professional Edition :briefcase:

Fast-forward to 2013: I was ready to go pro. I showcased my personal projects to a soon-to-be-manager, and boom—hired on the spot. Thus began my official software development career.

Since then, I’ve journeyed through various industries, including but not limited to:

- ERP software  
- Car garage management  
- Online job boards  
- Food and drink ordering systems  
- School safeguarding software  
- Payroll systems  
- Mental health tracking  
- Buy-to-let property EPC upgrades

## My Tools of Choice :wrench:

Along the way, I’ve embraced a range of programming languages, but the .NET framework and Angular have been my trusty companions. I thrive on writing in **C#** and **TypeScript**—two languages that feel like old friends at this point. Better still, their shared concepts make switching between them feel seamless.

And that’s me in a (code-covered) nutshell. Thanks for reading, and happy coding!
