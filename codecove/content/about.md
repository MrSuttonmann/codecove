It's probably best to introduce myself.

I'm **Ted**, a senior software developer based in *mostly* sunny [Staffordshire](https://enwp.org/Staffordshire). My software journey began back in 2009 during college, crafting small games and simulators using the almighty duo of [VB.NET](https://enwp.org/Visual_Basic_(.NET)) and [WinForms](https://enwp.org/Windows_Forms).

In 2011, I took my skills online with my first web app, `RideTrack` built in [PHP](https://enwp.org/PHP). It was a passion project created between shifts at a local holiday park. Armed with a yearly pass to [Alton Towers](https://enwp.org/Alton_Towers), I had an unstoppable urge to count how many times I’d braved *Oblivion* or looped on *Nemesis*. Ride stats were serious business.


Back then, my development style then was... let's say "adventurous". I coded over [SFTP](https://enwp.org/SSH_File_Transfer_Protocol) using [WinSCP](https://enwp.org/WinSCP) meaning:

* No syntax highlighting
* No intellisense
* No debugging tools
* **And worst of all, no dark mode**

Yes, I willingly lived like this. The horror! Looking back, it’s a wonder I didn’t scare myself off coding entirely.
